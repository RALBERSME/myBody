        <p>
          It is the oldest wheat and it is considered to be man’s first wheat.
          It's name is derived from the German language and means “single
          grain”.<br />
          Because it has a very fragile structure, it is optimal for human
          digestion.

          Emmer wheat or hulled wheat is a type of awned wheat.<br />
          It is not as fragile as Einkorn, but it still has a moderate stability and therefore it is still ok for human digestion.

          Sourdough or sourdough bread is a bread made by the fermentation of dough using wild lactobacillaceae and yeast.<br />
          Its structure is less complex but still more stable then the one of Einkorn. It is still better for human digestion than white wheat.

        <p>
          Breeding changed the growth of cereal plants. The stalks of the cereal were no longer as high and the cereal grains themselves became more stable. <br />
        The new wheat leads to human digestion problems.
