        This website aims to convey knowledge about the human body and how it
        works. To do this, it uses the content of books, images, graphics,
        statistics and videos from generally accessible sources, especially from
        experts. The website cannot guarantee the accuracy and completeness of
        these data and statements. It is therefore not liable for linked
        content. Always ask yourself whether the statements/data presented make
        sense to you after general human communication. Look up specialist
        literature yourself and educate yourself there.
        <br /><br />
        In any case, the following applies:
        <u
          >acquiring knowledge is no substitute for advice from a doctor or
          pharmacist.</u
        >
        If you are ill or not feeling well, see a doctor. It is also better not
        to carry out any exercises mentioned on this website until you have
        discussed everything with your doctor. If you feel that your doctor does
        not understand you, get the opinion of another, independent doctor.

          own health.</strong

        <br /><br />
        But maybe my website will inspire you to take the time to pay more
        attention to your health. If so, this website has achieved its goal.
