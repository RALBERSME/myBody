          Stem cells are cells that can renew themselves through cell division
          and at the same time produce specialized (differentiated) daughter
          cells. One day, embryonic stem cells will mature into heart, nerve and
          muscle cells, so that they can be used for new therapeutic
          applications to cure diseases such as Parkinson's, Alzheimer's or
          diabetes, etc. These stem cells can play a crucial role in delaying
          the aging process. In combination with anti-aging genes, they can
          create a sophisticated shield, which can prevent the effects of
          aging.<br /><br />

          People can now live to a very old age. While people in the Middle Ages
          reached 35 to 40 years, the current record is 118 years, almost three
          times as long.<br /><br />
          The French nun Andre Randon is considered the oldest person in the
          world. She was born on February 11, 1904 in Ales in the south of
          France as Lucile Randon and lived for 118 years. The oldest person
          currently seems to be around 115 years old.<br /><br />
          But growing old can only be enjoyed if you are still healthy.<br /><br />
          It is all the more important to eat healthily and get enough exercise
          (mentally and physically). This chapter deals with (supposed) secrets
          of how you can turn back the wheel of time for yourself.

          Aging is a disease (Arthritis, high blood pressure, cancer, diabetes,
          dementia, etc.). We are suffering DNA damage, telomere shortening,
          mitrochondrial dysfunction, loss of proteostasis, epigenetic
          alterations, cellular senescene, stem cell exhaustion, altered
          intercellular communication, deregulated nutrient sensing. Lifestyle
          Changes can improve your health, such as high intensive interval
          training, etc. - just watch the movie (21:01 min.)

          In this video it is explained how autophagy is scientifically proven
          to slow the appearance of aging by killing off damaged cells which are
          created by natural stressors. <br />It is based on interviews with the
          Nobel Prize winning Dr. Yoshinori Oshumi as well as Dr. William Dunn,
          in which they told about their life changing research surrounding
          autophagy <br />1. The Keto Diet: When on the ketogenic diet our
          bodies will begin to induce autophagy in a way similar to that which
          occurs while fasting. As your body shifts from being glucose-dependent
          to fat-dependent, autophagy allows the body to maintain energy
          homeostasis and create benefits from the starvation as opposed to
          detriments.<br />
          2. Intermittent fasting: While we fast, our cells enter a phase where
          they literally digest themselves to recycle and reuse the good while
          discarding the bad. If we constantly eat throughout the day, it
          doesn’t give our cells a chance to repair and clean up the waste and
          toxins that have accumulated.<br />
          3. Exercise:Exercise creates microtears and inflamed muscle tissue
          which activates the autophagic process to repair and optimize the
          muscles.<br />
          Exercise in moderation is more efficient than extreme sports.
          <br />
          4. Sleeping. The sleep is the easiest way of activating autophagy,
          simply because it requires no sacrifice or effort. <br />(9:06 min.)

          <p><u>Description:</u></p>
          <br />
          This video is 6:30 min long and deals with the following content:
          <br /><br />
          Our skin is made out of saturated fats, and in order to achieve
          youthful and younger-looking skin, you need to consume more saturated
          fats and cholesterol.
          <br /><br />
          Purpose of Saturated Fats and Cholesterol<br />
          • 50% of cell membranes are made of cholesterol. <br />
          • It helps to produce more bile to help digest the fats you consume
          and extract fat-soluble vitamins out of that fat. <br />
          • The cholesterol is needed to make hormones.
          <br /><br />
          Vitamin A is the most important anti-aging fat-soluble vitamin for the
          skin, and it also triggers the production of collagen. The different
          layers of the skin (epidermis and dermis) are controlled by vitamin A.
          <br /><br />
          Vitamin A Deficiency Symptoms:<br /><br />
          • Dry Skin <br />
          • Scaly Skin <br />
          • Cornification <br />
          • Rough Skin <br />
          • Acne<br />
          <br />
          Best Sources of Vitamin A: <br />
          • Leafy Greens <br />
          • B-Carotene<br />
          • Egg Yolk (Pasture-raised, organic)<br />
          • Virgin Cod Liver Oil <br />
          • Butter <br />
          • Salmon / Fish <br />
          • Goat Cheese <br />
          <br />
          Vitamin E is also very important for the skin. It helps protect the
          skin against aging, sunburn, oxidizing, prevents wrinkles and
          scarring, and supports the pituitary hormones.
          <br /><br />
          Best Sources of Vitamin E:<br /><br />
          • Palm Oil <br />
          • Leafy Greens <br />
          • Wheat Germ Oil <br />
          • Nuts / Seeds<br />
          • Olive Oil <br />
          <br />
          Things to AVOID to Help Prevent Aging:<br /><br />
          • AGEs or Advanced Glycation End Products<br />
          • Smoking <br />
          • Stress (cortisol)<br />
          • Sugar / Refined Carbohydrates
